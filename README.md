# PyGame Minigames

I've been whatchin too much [J1mmy's](https://www.youtube.com/@J1mmy) By Release
series. Forcing my brain into the RuneScape mindset again.

But instead of playing, I want to make a few minigames based on the idea of
RuneScape's skilling.


## Before We Begin

This is just a few ideas, and should be used for learning or as inspiration.
Please don't look at theese as tutorials, or as a 'how to'.

## :bulb: Concept

Create a bunch of minigames inspired by the skills in RuneScape. Delve into the
core ideas of the skills, making the minigames improvements to the grinding
and leveling of those skills.

### MiniGames

#### Prospecting

Prospecting is the minigame that precedes the mining. Adding bonuses to your
mining and to the resources gathered during the mining minigame.

##### Prospecting No. 1

Be quick and collect all the shiny ore specs that you can find before the 
ground 'cakes up'.
Be careful not to hit the hard rocks with your pickaxe, or it might get dull!
